# Arduno Based Bling Spot Detector

This is an Arduino based interface for a blind spot detector for blind people in which they can navigate themselves without the worry of hitting into other people.
The main brains behind this is the Arduino Uno board which can be swapped out for a smaller Arduino board. This is connected to a Ultrasonic Sensor and a Peizo electric sensor in which as the proximixy of the Blind person to the person is smaller the Buzzer buzzes with a higher frequency
